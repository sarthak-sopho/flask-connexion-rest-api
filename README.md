# A simple flask connexion REST API

### Why am I using connexion, when a REST API can be easily made with Flask?
The Connexion module allows a Python program to use the Swagger specification. This provides a lot of functionality: validation of input and output data to and from your API, an easy way to configure the API URL endpoints and the parameters expected, and a really nice UI interface to work with the created API and explore it.

All of this can happen when you create a configuration file your application can access. The Swagger site even provides an online configuration editor tool to help create and/or syntax check the configuration file you will create.
